# Munaam Farooqui - Web Developer

Hello! I'm Munaam Farooqui, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends and best practices.

## Technologies & Skills

### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. I use HTML to structure content on the web, ensuring a semantic and accessible structure for all users.

### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style web pages. I create responsive designs using CSS, ensuring that websites look great on devices of all sizes. I have experience with advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

### JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity to websites. I use JS to make web pages dynamic, create custom animations, and handle events. I am familiar with ES6+ features and asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that helps me build responsive websites quickly. I use Bootstrap to create flexible layouts, navigation, and form designs that work seamlessly across devices.
